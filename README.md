# MakeUrChoice
# INSPIRATION :
In this modern word of democracy we need many tools for our day to day life. A good polling system is very essential tool.
In this situation we the students need a good system to eradicate any ambiguity among ourself.
Our team decided to make a website with various polling features to overcome this situation.

# What the project does :
The project brings out a modern way of polling , idea is to create secured polling website , with our own voting system, named PVS(preferential voting system), where candidates is chose upon preferences and of every voter, not just by majority votes. The site also provides you a feature so that only certain people can vote in the poll , you can also form groups if needed to send the polls on regular basis.

PVS(preferential voting system): This is a system that aims to revolutionize the whole voting system that lets the only majority to win. In this system every voter is allowed to choose their preference order of options and the best preferred option comes out as the result , this result comes out on the basis of algorithm which has been developed by M S Vamsi. This leads to an option which has been chosen by every voter one way or other and not just majority.


Challenges faced: We faced many challenges during the project. The most prominent one would be the inexperience of team and communication barriers between team members due to online means of contact only. The designers were forced to redesign many times due to defect in small details. The back end developer faced problems with node, there were many errors and debugging was proving to be quite a strenuous task. He had to shift to Django which is much better structured and the debugging was not so taxing. 

#Things learnt:
Many new skills were learned by the whole team while making of project. The first and foremost thing learnt was teamwork which was very essential to make this idea alive. The team also learnt time management as a whole. Individually many other skills were learnt by the team which are listed down.

M S Vamsi: I learned Django, just for this project, this deadline boosted me to learn Django in one day and start implementing stuff, hackathon really boosted our confidence and made  us work effectively as a team.

Sarthak Bindal:  I learned bootstrap .Deep dived into styling and designing. Learned how to deal with deadlines and how to work effectively under a team.

Prajjwal Jogdand: I learned UI/UX design gained experience in front end development and project build up 
team work and working under deadlines.

Harsh Raj: I learned the fine art of preparing ideas and executing them. Leaned some designing through Canva and did some video editing too. Also learned how to present the project in a very sophisticated way. 

# How you built the project : 
As  a team we first brainstormed the ideas about the project and got together a rough structure so that we could complete this project in time. Further we dived the work among ourselves in three different categories at large - frontend developers , backend developers and content and presentation. 
This made it very easy and efficient to work on project.
The project was built with HTML5, CSS3 , JavaScript , Django and many more other.


What’s next planned for the project if given more time :
The first and foremost thing would be a better Ui/UX. We would also like to add many other features in polls like self ending pole on a particular pole. There will be various themes to base the polls on in the future. 
A better security would be on our focus too as it is one of the most important and prized aspect of voting. Given more time the team would like to add a feature that allows organizations to make their own group which lets only the members to only vote once. In the group the heads will be able to post polls hassle free and wouldn’t have to worry about sending links to everyone as the website will send notification via emails and reminder emails too.
We would also like to replace the voting system of our country(EVMs) with this tool which would result in election of a leader who was voted by all and not just a particular group of people who were in majority. This would also lead to  cost cutting in the elections.
